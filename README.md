A Website which analyzes what does a research paper contains and returns key insights, summary, scientific terms with their meanings and Score
Research Paper Analyzer uses a systematic  multi-stage pipeline to process, analyze and evaluate academic work that transforms bioscience texts into implementable knowledge. By integrating NLP models (advanced natural language processing), evaluation mechanisms for AI control, and an interactive web-based visualization platform, the system provides researchers with a seamless and efficient solution. This section provides a detailed description of the system architecture and its core components. These phases ensure accurate text extraction, robust preprocessing, outline revealing, and intuitive presentation of the results.
